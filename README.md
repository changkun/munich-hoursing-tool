> This repository is still in developing, please feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/changkun/munich-housing-tool/issues) or pull a [request](https://github.com/changkun/munich-housing-tool/pulls) if you have any new idea or requirements.

## Motivation

It's generally known that renting in Munich is a huge probelm for everyone. As a fresh student, we can not afford such high rents over than 600 Euro if we do not applied a student domitory.

The **Studentenwerk Muenchen** provides Housing Referral Service, which has a loads of housing informations. However, unfortunately, their information lists in a table and quite difficult to use for us. 

Thus, a convenient renting tool becomes a necessity.

## Usage

### `housing-spider.py`

`housing-spider.py` is a simple spider to download housing infomations from **Studentenwerk Muenchen**, just simply run:

```bash
python housing-spider.py
```

Then you should get a `.csv` file in this folder, which contains all the housing informations provided by Studentenwerk Muenchen.

### `index.html`

> **IMPORTANT:** Considering security reason, you cannot straightly use this file due to it contains my private key of Google Map, you need to [**apply**](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) an **Google Map JavaScript API KEY** on your own, and put it in the following content, which is in the `index.html`:

> ```html
> <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?> key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap" async defer></script>
> ``` 

Once you have the `rent.csv` file, you should be able to use `index.html` to visualize all the informations in a map that allows you to check all the housing infos quickly and intuitional.

For usage, just simply choose the `.csv` file in the web page, then you will get all you need.
